How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?
You can interpret user needs by following the information from the product owner. 
User Stories are stories related to how a user should expect the project to work. User stories work as a blueprint to ensure we are giving the customer exactly what they want.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Developing programs start with an outline from the product owner, and which has been agreed on by the Scrum team. 
After the outline is agreed upon, the developer can decide on an agile process to utilize including: waterfall, agile, iterative, prototype, etc.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member one must be able to comminicate effectively. Good team members ensure there work is done correctly and on time so as not to delay the team.
Good team members get along well with other members of the team and remain highly motivated. Good team members work well without constant supervision and gratification.
